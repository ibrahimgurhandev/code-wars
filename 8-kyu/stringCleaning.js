// Your boss decided to save money by purchasing some cut-rate
// optical character recognition software for scanning in the
// text of old novels to your database. At first it seems to
// capture words okay, but you quickly notice that it throws
//  in a lot of numbers at random places in the text. For example:

// stringClean('! !') == '! !'
// stringClean('123456789') == ''
// stringClean('This looks5 grea8t!') == 'This looks great!'
// Your harried co-workers are looking to you for a solution
// to take this garbled text and remove all of the numbers.
// Your program will take in a string and clean out all numeric
//  characters, and return a string with spacing and special
//   characters ~#$%^&!@*():;"'.,? all intact.

// I split the digits with using /d and then joined
